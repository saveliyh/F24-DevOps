# Task 1
## Overall boot
To check it I ran command `systemd-analyze` it's output was:
```
Startup finished in 7.041s (firmware) + 7.879s (loader) + 1.735s (kernel) + 1.919s (initrd) + 11.324s (userspace) = 29.900s 
graphical.target reached after 11.306s in userspace.
```

So boot took 29.9 seconds.
## slow services
To get 5 top slow services I ran command `systemd-analyze blame | head -n5` and got:
```
15.861s dnf-makecache.service
 4.019s NetworkManager-wait-online.service
 3.291s docker.service
 3.136s plymouth-quit-wait.service
 3.051s sys-module-fuse.device
```

## Uptime and load
For checking uptime and load can be used `w` or `uptime` commands but `uptime` is redundant for my case because it shows the same information as `w` and not too much information. This can be see by output of next command `uptime && echo ---- && w`:
```
 11:38:46 up 1 day, 11:17,  1 user,  load average: 2.84, 1.62, 1.45
----
 11:38:46 up 1 day, 11:17,  1 user,  load average: 2.84, 1.62, 1.45
USER     TTY        LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
saveliy  tty2      Wed00   35:17m  0.03s  0.03s /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary
```

from it we can see that system has been up for 1 day 11 hours and 17 minutes for moment 11:38:46 of 19th, september. and average load for last minute is 2.84 CPU cores, for last 5 minutes 1.62 CPU cores, and for last 15 minutes 1.45 CPU cores.

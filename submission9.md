# Task 1

## Creating GitHub Actions

1. I created file `./github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yaml` in special directory for GitHub actions
2. In this file I specified environment, triggers, and commands to execute.

## Observations after commit

- GitHub action triggered by push
- GitHub can see added file in repository
- GitHub checkout does not pull special github files like file with github actions
